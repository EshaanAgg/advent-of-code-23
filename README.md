# Advent of Code '23

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code[^aoc] 2023, so that the elves can deliver your Christmas gifts on time. Since Santa really doesn't care about what nerdy langauge I commit to, I plan on trying to be a polygot this year, and would try to solve the problems in multiple ways, as and when I get the time.

Happy holidays!

### Disclaimers

- I hate the fact that I have to use 🇬 to represent `Go`. Please Unicode gods, grant us with a gopher emoji🙏.
- This is the first time I am using `OCaml` and I am still on the verge whether I hate it or I find it bearable. I am super new to the paradigms of functional programming and the notion that "everything is a list", so I use the `Primeagen's` daily AOC streams to reason out a good thought process to model the problem, and then try to write the code myself. It's tiring, but it gives me a cool nerdy rush.
- I have no good `JS` emojis as well -\_- I don't plan on doing JS as a language this AOC, but rather love it for the purpose of speed-running and flexing.

    [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
