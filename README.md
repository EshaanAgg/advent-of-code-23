# Advent of Code '23

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code[^aoc] 2023, so that the elves can deliver your Christmas gifts on time. Since Santa really doesn't care about what nerdy langauge I commit to, I plan on trying to be a polygot this year, and would try to solve the problems in multiple ways, as and when I get the time.

Happy holidays!

### Disclaimers

- I hate the fact that I have to use 🇬 to represent `Go`. Please Unicode gods, grant us with a gopher emoji🙏.
- This is the first time I am using `OCaml` and I am still on the verge whether I hate it or I find it bearable. For the most part my `OCaml` code is going to resemble a lot of that the Primeagen, with me trying to take the reigns in between.

    [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
