# Advent of Code '23

This repository contains my solutions to [`Advent of Code 2023`](https://adventofcode.com/) so that the elves can deliver your Christmas gifts on time. Since Santa really doesn't care about what nerdy langauge I commit to, I plan on trying to be a polygot this year, and would try to solve the problems in multiple ways, as and when I get the time.

Happy holidays!
